I've been wondering "How advanced can an email scrapper get... *without AI*?", so I made this as a challenge to myself!

This is just a personal project made for fun, and to learn [CS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and Rust.

For the reasons mentioned, above I'll **never**:
- distribute executables/binaries (compile it yourself, MF)
- release a `1.x` version (always unstable)
- publish to Crates.io
