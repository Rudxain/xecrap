## Name
It stands for "e**x**perimental **e**mail s**crap**per.

Notice the suspicious emphasis on "crap". It's a sign that you should feel like that, if you ever include similar code into a web-crawler that feeds a spam-bot.

## Why
I've been wondering "How advanced can an email scrapper get... *without AI*?", so I made this as a challenge to myself!

This is just a "personal project" made for fun, and learning/research. It's also intended to raise awareness about [data brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_broker).

For the reasons mentioned above, **I won't**:
- distribute executables/binaries (compile it yourself, MF)
- release a `1.x` version (always unstable)
- publish to a package registry, market/store, or repository.

## Other
This is probably the most ethically-questionable software I've ever written. If you believe I'm doing more harm than good, please explain why. I may archive this repo if I feel "guilty enough"

## CONTRIBUTING
Contributions are welcome (and "unwelcome"), but please don't contrib until I choose a license
